    <h2>
      Mexico

      I'd like to visit Mexico because that's where my parents are from, and I'd
      love to learn more about the culture by traveling all over the country. I
      could also finally meet all of my relatives and experience things like
      going to the beaches and see my cousin play professional soccer.

      This is my fifth year of learning Japanese, so being able to go there and
      practice with natives would be an exciting experience. Going to Osaka,
      Okinawa, Tokyo, and Shibuya would be the main destinations. I would most
      want to try the street food and go to a hot spring. I'm supposed to go
      with my graduating class this summer, so I really hope that covid ends
      quickly so I can still go.

      />
      I do appreciate Korean music, but I think it would just be a fun journey
      in general because of how interesting their culture is. I have tried some
      Korean food like tteokbokki, kimchi, and Korean BBQ.

      Because I know Spanish, it would be fun to go somewhere that has a
      completely different culture but still speaks the same language. Spanish
      architecture is so intricate and beautiful, which is one of the main
      reasons I would visit there.

      Similar to Spain, I don't know much about Australia, but English is spoken
      there, so it'd be easy to go and would be a fun experience. Plus, I know
      some people who are from there, so it would be great to see the
      differences between Australia and the United States.

      />
      Learning about world history, Italy always seemed so interesting because
      of places like Rome and the Vatican, so I would love to go there and see
      the architecture and culture that I am not very knowledgeable in.
